APOE-C130R,APOE,"This is generally known as the ApoE4 allele of ApoE and is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's. 20-25% of individuals are heterozygous for this variant, and 1-2% are homozygous. Data from Khachaturian et al. suggests an average 7% of all individuals developed Alzheimer's by the age of 80; when this is split by ApoE4 status: 10% of ApoE4 heterozygotes (3% increased attributable risk), 40% of ApoE4 homozygotes (33% increased attributable risk), and 5% of non-carriers (2% decreased attributable risk). Notably, their model suggests 70-75% of people would eventually develop Alzheimer's by the age of 100 regardless of ApoE4 genotype (and 25-30% are resistant, regardless of genotype), but that ApoE4 variants shift the disease onset to occur significantly earlier (4 years earlier for heterozygous carriers, 13 years for homozygotes).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.14,Mental and behavioral;Nervous system,Complex/Other,Heterozygous,9343467;11950276;15123497;17428983,rs429358,4,chr19,45411941,C,http://evidence.pgp-hms.org/genomes?display_genome_id=24086a2e52e638de06424fed372f61001e3fe361

This variant is evolutionarily ancestral, and in vitro studies fail to support an impact of this variant on enzyme activity. Carney et al. instead implicate a 4 base deletion on the 5' of the GALT gene as being causal and linked to this variant. Galactosemia is typically screened and detected in infants and causes early, severe but nonspecific symptoms (digestive problems, lethargy, failure to thrive).",Low,Uncertain,Benign,0.072,"Mouth, liver, and digestive",Unknown,Heterozygous,10408771;11261429;19224951,rs2070074,,chr9,34649442,G,http://evidence.pgp-hms.org/genomes?display_genome_id=24086a2e52e638de06424fed372f61001e3fe361
