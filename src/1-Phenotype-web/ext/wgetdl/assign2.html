            <ol>
                <li> I am majoring in Political Science and minoring in Computer
                    Science
                <li> I am from Greece (where the best beaches are!)
                    <br>

                <li> I enjoy hanging out with friends, travelling, and cooking
            </ol>



            <br> <!-- Section with a paragraph describing why I am taking CS110 -->
            <h2 class="h2_cs110">Why am I taking CS110?</h2>
                <p> As a CS minor, I have taken many courses in the computer science
                    department. However, I do not feel as I am as proficient in
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I would like to be. Therefore, I
                    decided to take this course as a refresher and a way to expand
                    my knowledge.
                </p>

            <br> <!-- Section with a paragraph describing my hobbies -->
            <h2 class="h2_hobbies">What are my hobbies?</h2>
            <p> One of my main hobbies is travelling. I especially enjoy
                travelling around Europe and Asia. Last year, my family and I
                went to Vietnam for Christmas and it was a fantastic experience.
                It was really interesting to see a completely different culture
                and especially interesting since I had learnt and read a lot
                about Vietnam in many of my classes at Wellesley. Over the next
                few years, I hope to keep travelling and learning more about the
                world around me.

                <br>
                <br> <!--breaks so that it looks good -->
                Another one of my hobbies is cooking. I especially enjoy making
                deserts, such as chocolate cake. However, since it is hard to
                cook elaborate deserts in Wellesley's kitchens, I have only had
                the chance to bake cookies with friends.
                <br>
