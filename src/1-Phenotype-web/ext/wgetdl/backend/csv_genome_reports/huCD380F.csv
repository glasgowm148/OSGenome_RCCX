GALT-N314D,GALT,"This variant has an allele frequency of ~8% and is ancestral to ""Duarte"" / ""Duarte 2"" and ""Duarte 1""/""Los Angeles"" galactosemia variants. This variant is evolutionarily ancestral, and in vitro studies fail to support an impact of this variant on enzyme activity. Carney et al. instead implicate a 4 base deletion on the 5' of the GALT gene as being causal and linked to this variant.
