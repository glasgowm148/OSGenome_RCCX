    "Summary": "This variant was initially reported to be a risk factor for glaucoma, but subsequent reports have failed to find a statistically significant association. It may have a modifier effect, with carriers of the variant having lower intraocular pressure on average -- pressures that might be considered normal in other individuals would be abnormally high for carriers of this variant.",
