    "Summary": "Probably nonpathogenic. Reported in a single case of tetralogy of fallot (a congenital heart defect), although an unaffected mother and grandmother were also carriers. A later study also found the variant in an affected family, but the variant did not segregate with disease (other affected family members were *not* carriers) -- they conclude that it is probably a nonpathogenic polymorphism.",
