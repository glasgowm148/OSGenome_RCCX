    "Summary": "Associated with a decreased risk for age related macular degeneration (ARMD). Homozygotes for this have a 4-5% decreased attributable risk (3-4% vs. average 8% risk), heterozygotes have slightly lower than average risk (7%). Non-carriers have an increased risk (12-13%). ARMD impairs sharp vision as age progresses. While there is no cure, treatment can slow progression of the disease and environmental factors (smoking and obesity) contribute to higher risk.",
