    "Summary": "Reported to cause cryptorchidism, as recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000004376/). This assertion comes from Gorlov et al 2002 (PMID: 12217959) and Ferlin et al 2003 (PMID: 12970298). Gorlov et al found this variant in 1 of 61 patients and, according to OMIM, Ferlin et al found the variant in 4 of 87 patients. ExAC data reports this variant has an allele frequency of 0.7% in Europeans, and Ferlin et al's finding has weak significance for enrichment relative to this allele frequency (p = 0.037). Although cryptorchidism is common, so is this variant \u2013 1 in 70 Europeans are carriers: if it had this effect with high penetrance we would see highly significant enrichment in patients. Although the variant could potentially be a risk factor there is no strong evidence for making this assertion, and the hypothesized effect recorded in ClinVar (i.e. high penetrance) should be considered disproven.",
