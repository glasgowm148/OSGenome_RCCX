    "Summary": "Reported to cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in a recessive manner, and is reported by ClinVar where it has been reported by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000030914/). This report comes from Costa et al 2001 (PMID: 11397871), who studied 14 familias and saw this homozygous in one patient. In ExAC data this is rare; 1 in 3000 are carriers for this variant.",
