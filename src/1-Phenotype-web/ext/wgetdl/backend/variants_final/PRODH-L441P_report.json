    "Summary": "Causes hyperprolinemia in a recessive manner (high levels of proline in the blood due to a defect in metabolism of this amino acid). This can sometimes lead to seizures, mental retardation, and other neurological manifestations. Some authors also hypothesize hyperprolinemia is a risk factor for schizophrenia, but this is less well supported and the effect of this variant on risk for that disease is unclear.",
