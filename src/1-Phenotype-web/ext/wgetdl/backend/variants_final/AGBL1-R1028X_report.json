    "Summary": "Despite a relatively high allele frequency, Riazuddin et al. 2013 reported finding it causing high penetrance Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy in a three generation family. The authors claimed that the allele frequency in the general population (1 in 330 Europeans are carriers) was not inconsistent with their hypothesis, as it is \"considerably below\" the >4% incidence of this late onset disease.\n\nAlthough the variant is rarer than the disease, the authors' hypothesis implies the variant accounts for a very significant fraction of the disease (>5%), and would be easily confirmed with case/control studies. The combination of a lack of confirming evidence, and relatively high allele frequency,appears to contradict the hypothesis proposed by Riazuddin et al.",
