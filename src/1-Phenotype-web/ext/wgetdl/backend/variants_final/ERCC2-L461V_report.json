    "Summary": "Reported to cause Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) and Photosensitive Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) in a recessive manner. These effects are recorded in ClinVar by OMIM and come, respectively, from Frederick et al 1994 (PMID: 7849702), and Takayama et al 1996 & Takayama et al 1997 (PMID: 8571952 & PMID: 9195225). Notably, the latter papers implicated this variant only in combination with a 15 amino acid deletion on the same chromosome (expected to have a more severe effect \u2013 so this variant may have been coincidental and not causal). In ExAC data this variant has an allele frequency of 0.7% in South Asian ancestry, which means at least 1 in 20,000 with South Asian ancestry are expected to be homozygous. In contrast, XP and TTD are both much rarer, with incidences of 1 inn 250,000 to 1,000,000. This information, combined with a lack of more recent confirming literature, indicates the reported effects should probably be considered disproven.",
