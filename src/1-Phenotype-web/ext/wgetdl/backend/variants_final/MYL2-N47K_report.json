    "Summary": "Reported in ClinVar by multiple groups, potentially causing cardiomyopathy in a dominant fashion (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/31766/). GeneDx classified this as pathogenic, and other groups classified the effect as uncertain. However, according to ExAC data 1 in 1700 with European descent carry this variant. This could be seen as contradicting the proposed effect, because such a high frequency would suggest this variant (if causal) should account for a large fraction of cases and should thus have strong supporting evidence (i.e. far stronger than \"uncertain\" status with specialist groups).",
