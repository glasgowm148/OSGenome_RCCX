    "Summary": "This variant is associated with eye color, as is OCA2 R305W. Individuals with this variant are reported to be more likely to have green/hazel eyes as opposed to blue/gray eyes. Other variants in this gene are associated with oculocutaneous albinism (albinism which involves skin and eyes).",
