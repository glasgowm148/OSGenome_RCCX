    "Summary": "Reported by LapCorp to ClinVar as a \"likely pathogenic\" cause of cardiomyopathy: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000029690/  It's unclear what inheritance pattern is proposed or what evidence is supports this hypothesis. This gene is usually associated with Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, and ExAC data indicates that this may be a low quality site in genome/exome sequencing.",
