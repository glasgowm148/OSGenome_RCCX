    "Summary": "This variant is associated with inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase deficiency and may be associated with an adverse reaction to thiopurine drugs (which are used as immunosuppressants). Homozygotes have no detectable ITPase activity, individuals compound heterozygous with another less severe mutation also have severely reduced enzyme activity.",
