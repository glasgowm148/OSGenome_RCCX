    "Summary": "Reported to cause primary open angle glaucoma in a recessive manner. This assertion in ClinVar is reported by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000008185/), and is based on Melki et al 2004 (PMID: 15342693). Studying 236 unrelated patients, this variant was seen heterozygously in two of them. Although the authors didn't find this mutation in 394 control chromosomes, ExAC data indicates this variant has an allele frequency of 0.7% in European ancestry. About 1 in 70 are expected to carry the variant, and so finding it twice in 236 individuals represents no enrichment relative to the general population.",
