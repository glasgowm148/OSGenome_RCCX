    "Summary": "Reported as \"EDNRB, 1-BP INS, 878T\" in OMIM, this frameshift variant has been reported to cause increased susceptibility to Hirschsprung's disease (partial lack of nerves in the bowel, potentially leading to severe constipation and digestive issues). It may also be associated with Waardenburg syndrome type 4 in a recessive or incomplete-dominance manner.",
