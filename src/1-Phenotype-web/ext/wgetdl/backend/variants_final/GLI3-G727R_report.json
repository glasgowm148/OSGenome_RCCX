    "Summary": "Reported to cause postaxial polydactyly in a dominant manner. However it was only observed in one family, another linked variant in the region may have been causal. Data in the exome variant server shows 1 in 100 carry this variant, contracting the polydactyly effect -- if that hypothesis were true, this variant is common enough that it would account for a large fraction of cases (i.e. many other publications would exist confirming the hypothesis).\n\nOther variants in this gene cause Pallister-Hall syndrome, which causes many traits including polydactyly and hypothalamic hamartoma (a congenital brain malformation that can cause seizures).",
