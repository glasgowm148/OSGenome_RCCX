    "Summary": "This is also called the \"Pi Z\" or \"Z\" allele. When homozygous (acting in a recessive manner) this variant is the major cause of severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (95% of cases) which often leads to emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease in adults and children. Heterozygosity for this variant may also be associated with increased rate of lung or liver problems, especially when combined with another variant with reduced function (compound heterozygous).",
