    "Summary": "This common noncoding genetic variant has an allele frequency of ~30% and is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. If ~25% of non-carriers have hypertension, Bonnardeaux et al's data predict ~4% increased risk of hypertension per copy of this variant. This SNP is in the 3' noncoding region of the AGTR1 transcript (angiotensin II type 1 receptor), also known as AT2R1 or AT1R, which is a target of hypertension drugs.",
