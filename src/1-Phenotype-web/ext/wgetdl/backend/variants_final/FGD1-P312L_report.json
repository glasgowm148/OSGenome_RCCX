    "Summary": "Extremely rare variant, reported to cause X-linked mental retardation. Only one case observed -- not enough information to establish statistical significance (it is also possible this was an unusual coincidental finding). Other mutations in this gene cause Aarskog-Scott syndrome, however the family reported did not have features of this syndrome.",
