    "Summary": "Causes factor XI deficiency, causing increased bleeding and impaired clotting. Recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000012667/), this effect seems to be well-established by literature and is found in patients with Ashkenazi ancestry. Asakai et al 1991 (PMID: 2052060) called this variant \"Type III\" and report it accounted for 47% of disease-causing alleles in 46 patients studied.",
