    "Summary": "Reported to cause Familial Mediterranean Fever in a recessive manner, recorded in ClinVar by OMIM and another clinical group (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000002656/). This report comes from Bernot et al 1998 (PMID: 9668175) who screened 120 patient chromosomes and report seeing this in 3 Jewish families. However, the variant is relatively common with 0.8% frequency in European ancestry. This strongly contradicts the reported effect, and the observation of Bernot et al is not statistically different from this population data.",
