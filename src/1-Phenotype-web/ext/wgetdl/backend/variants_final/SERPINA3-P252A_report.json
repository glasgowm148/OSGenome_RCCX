    "Summary": "An uncommon variant carried by about 1 in 100 Europeans. Claimed by Poller et al. 1993 to cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD )in three generations of an affected family, implying a Mendelian hypothesis. Seifart, et al 2007 mentions that publication and states that the association was not replicated in Japanese, and that no association was found in a study of Italian cases.",
