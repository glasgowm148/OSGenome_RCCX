    "Summary": "This variant is associated with an increased risk of cataracts in old age, acting in a dominant fashion. Jun et al. report 78% of carriers who are over 70 years old had cataracts. Cataracts are common in older individuals in general (we estimate ~20% have cortical cataracts in this age range on average), but this still implies a significant increased risk.",
