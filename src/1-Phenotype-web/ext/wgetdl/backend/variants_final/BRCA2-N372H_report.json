    "Summary": "This is a common variant of BRCA2 (HapMap allele frequency of 23%). The variant is weakly associated with an increased chance of breast cancer, and zygosity of the variant is associated with sex of children: male children are more likely to be homozygous for this variant, female children are more likely to be heterozygous.",
