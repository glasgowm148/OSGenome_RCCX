    "Summary": "Although there are no known reports for this variant, this is predicted to be very disruptive in a gene associated with recessive ciliopathy disorders (mostly Joubert Syndrome and/or Leber's Congenital Amaurosis). This variant would be predicted to have a similarly severe recessive pathogenic effect.",
