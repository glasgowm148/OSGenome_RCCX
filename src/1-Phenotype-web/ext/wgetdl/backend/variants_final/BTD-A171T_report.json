    "Summary": "This variant, which has always been reported as occurring with the D444H variant, is implicated in causing biotinidase deficiency. The double-mutant appears to abolish enzyme activity, but there is a report of homozygous asymptomatic adults with profound biotinidase deficiency (symptoms may depend on additional factors). This double-variant (A171T and D444H) has been observed to cause deficiency in a compound heterozygous fashion when paired with another, more severe mutation.",
