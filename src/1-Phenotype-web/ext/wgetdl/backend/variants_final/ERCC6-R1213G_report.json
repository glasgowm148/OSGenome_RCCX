    "Summary": "When homozygous, this variant may cause Cockayne Syndrome, which is a severe autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by abnormal early growth and development, abnormal sensitivity to sunlight, and premature aging. Cockayne Syndrome Type I and Type II lead to death in early childhood. Several other variants in the ERCC6 gene are linked to Cockayne Syndrome. This variant may also be linked to age-related macular degeneration like other ERCC6 variants, and has been linked to colorectal cancer in one study. ",
