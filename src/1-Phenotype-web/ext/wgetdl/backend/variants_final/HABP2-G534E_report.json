    "Summary": "Known as the \"Marburg I\" polymorphism, this variant is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in individuals with elevated cholesterol, triglyceride, and fibrinogen levels (5-fold risk of a CHD event, compared to 2-fold risk increase in people with the same risk factors but do not have this variant). In individuals without these elevated levels, however, carriers of the variant do not appear to have any increased risk of CHD.",
