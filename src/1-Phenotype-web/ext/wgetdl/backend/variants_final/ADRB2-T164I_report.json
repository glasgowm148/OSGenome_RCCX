    "Summary": "This rare variant in \u03b22-Adrenoceptor has only reported heterozygously (in 2-4% of the population) and strongly decreases the protein\u2019s responsiveness to inducing compounds (agonists). Carriers of this variant are less sensitive to induction of increased heart rate, heart contraction, and vasodilation by \u03b2-AR agonists. Mixed data suggests that this variant does not have a significant impact on hypertension or heart disease. It may affect responsiveness to beta blocker drugs.",
