    "Summary": "Rare, tentatively classified as benign. Polyphen 2 predicts a damaging effect and other variants in this gene are reported to cause serious diseases, but most of these are dominant and have phenotypes contradicted by the presence of this variant in a healthy PGP participant. Variants reported to cause recessive disease are more severe than this variant (nonsense instead of missense mutations).",
