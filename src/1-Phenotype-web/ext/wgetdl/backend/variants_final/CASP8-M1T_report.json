    "Summary": "Probably benign. Although start codons can be extremely disruptive and this gene is implicated in a rare disease (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome), the allele frequency for this variant (2-3%) is high enough to contradict such a strong pathogenic effect. This may be because the gene has many other transcripts that do not include this position as exonic.",
