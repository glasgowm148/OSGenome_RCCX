    "Summary": "This variant is predicted to be highly disruptive. Although other disruptive variants in this gene are reported to cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome in a recessive manner (a rare, fatal childhood disease), those variants were upstream of this position, and this variant is too common to be consistent with causing that disease (2% allele frequency). Based on this, it is tentatively evaluated as benign.",
