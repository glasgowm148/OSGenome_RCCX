    "Summary": "Associated with exfoliative glaucoma & syndrome (XFG & XFS) in various populations, but with contradicting results (protective in Caucasians, pathogenic in Japanese). Based on this it seems the variation itself -- although it affects protein structure -- is not itself causing disease. Instead it is likely associated with other nearby causal variants. As such, it is evaluated as benign by GET-Evidence (which focuses on reporting causal variants). See detailed variant report for disease risk associations.",
