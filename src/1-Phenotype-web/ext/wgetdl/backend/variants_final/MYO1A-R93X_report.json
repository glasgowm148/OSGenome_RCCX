    "Summary": "Reported to cause deafness in a dominant manner, as recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000008623/). This effect comes from Donaudy et al 2003 (PMID: 12736868), who saw this variant once in a study of 230 Italian hearing-impaired patients. However, this variant has an allele frequency of 0.42% in European ExAC data \u2013 1 in 120 are expected to carry the variant. Donaudy et al's observation matches the population in general, and the allele frequency far exceeds the prevalence of the condition; thus, this reported effect should be considered disproven.",
