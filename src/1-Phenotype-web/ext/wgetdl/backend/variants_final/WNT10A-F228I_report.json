    "Summary": "Causes ectodermal dysplasia in a recessive manner (malformations of teeth and nails, abnormal/loss of sweating). Although reports have high statistical significance, allele frequency for this variant is high relative to the incidence of the disease. This suggests it may be milder than other pathogenic variants and cause disease with less than 100% penetrance and/or that the disease is more common than reported. Bohring et al. report heterozygotes for pathogenic variants in this gene often have milder skin, tooth, and nail abnormalities, with males having a higher rate of tooth abnormalities.",
