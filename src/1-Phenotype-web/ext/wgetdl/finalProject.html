        <h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
        <p>
            Before we start analyzing the data and try to draw conclusions about Wellesley and its departments, there needs to be some cleaning
            of the data so that it can be used.
            <br><br>
            Data were parsed from three data sources into tidy data frames in Pandas, one with course enrollment details and one with withdrawal information. Pandas functionalities and regular expressions were used to extract department codes and course information from course codes within this parsing process, which resulted in each row of the data frame corresponding to a distinct class section from a distinct semester. Departments were categorized into subject areas, namely humanities, social sciences, or sciences, in order to carry out the analyses necessary to answer question 2.

        <h2>1. How do departments differ?</h2>
        <h3>Which departments have the largest class sizes? Smallest class sizes?</h3>
        <p>The largest class size was 120 students, in the Art History Department.</p>
        <p>Now let's examine which departments have the biggest and smallest class sizes on average.</p>
        <p><b>Results</b>:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Smallest Department Class Size Average:  0.0</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Smallest Class Size Average:  EC</li>
                <br>
                <li>Largest Department Class Size Average:  28.0</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Largest Class Size Average:  EAS</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Looking at averages is tricky because departments with only one class weight that particular class much higher than departments with many classes.</p>
        <p>To avoid this problem, I'll look only at departments that have had at least 10 classes in the past 15 years.</p>
        <p><b>Results</b>:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Smallest Department Class Size Average:  4.59090909091</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Smallest Class Size Average:  SWA</li>
                <br>
                <li>Largest Department Class Size Average:  24.0517241379</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Largest Class Size Average:  PEAC</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>:It seems that Swahili and Peace and Justice Studies are our winners with class averages of 4.6 and 24 students respectively.</p>

        <h3>Which departments have the greatest variance in class sizes?</h3>
        <p>Again, we'll limit this analysis to departments with over ten classes.</p>
        <p><b>Results</b>:
            <ul>
                <li>Smallest Department Class Size Variance:  4.17331254177</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Smallest Class Size Variance:  HEBR</li>
                <br>
                <li>Largest Department Class Size Variance:  566.850611136</li>
                <li>Department(s) with Largest Class Size Variance:  GEOL</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>It seems that Hebrew and Geology are our winners with class size variances of 4.2 and 566.9 respectively. 
            <br>
            But what does that really look like?</p>
        <p>Number of Hebrew classes:  67</p>
        <img src="images/bar0-0.png" alt="Enrollment in Hebrew classes" width=500>
        <p>Number of Geology classes:  94</p>
        <img src="images/bar0-1.png" alt="Enrollment in Geology classes" width=500>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Hebrew classes follow a normal distribution with small variance, whereas Geology has had a number of huge, outlier classes that skew its distribution to the right.</p>

        <h2>2. How do enrollments in Science, Social Science, and Humanities classes differ?</h2>
        <p>To determine which classes belong in which fields, we ...</p>
        <h3>What are the trends in these areas over time?</h3>
        <h4>Total classes offered per category:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Humanities: 8886 classes offered since 2000</li>
            <li>Social Sciences: 5387 classes offered since 2000</li>
            <li>Sciences: 7734 classes offered since 2000</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <div id="plotly-div-1"></div>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: So there are the most humanities classes available, then science classes and lastly social science with almost half 
            of the total humanities classes!
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>How has this changed over time?</h3>

        <h4>Humanities</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-1-1"></div>        
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: It has remained rather consistant, apart from a drop in 2009.
        </p>

        <h4>Social Sciences</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-1-2"></div>        
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: It has remained rather consistant throughout the years.
        </p>

        <h4>Sciences</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-1-3"></div>        
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Here, we see an increase in the later years!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h4>Total enrollments per category:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Humanities: 126730 enrollments since 2000</li>
            <li>Social Sciences: 96456 enrollments since 2000</li>
            <li>Sciences: 113438 enrollments since 2000</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <div id="plotly-div-2"></div>
        <p> <b>Conclusion</b>: It is interesting to note that there are more enrollments for humanities and there is a similar trend as the one seen
            above. This makes sense because the more classes offered, the more enrolled students there will thereotetically be.
        </p>
        <br>



        <h3>What are the typical class sizes?</h3>

        <h4>Average classes sizes per category:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Average class size for Humanities: 14 students</li>
            <li>Average class size for Social Sciences: 18 students</li>
            <li>Average class size for Sciences: 15 students</li>
        </ul>

        <br><br>
        <div id="plotly-div-3"></div>
        <br>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Social Science classes are the largest by average (despite having fewer classes and fewer enrollments). The Humanities classes and the Science classes have almost the same average class size.</p>
        <br>



        <h3>What about over the years?</h3>

        <h4>Humanities</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-2-1"></div>
        <p> <b>Conclusion</b>: Stayed about the same, except for an increase in 2009, which can be explained by there being less courses offered
             that year.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Social Sciences</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-2-2"></div>
        <p> <b>Conclusion</b>: Stayed about the same, with a subtle decrease in the later years.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h4>Sciences</h4>
        <div id="plotly-div-2-3"></div>
        <p> <b>Conclusion</b>: Stayed about the same, with subtle fluctations over the years.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h4>What about the typical 100, 200, 300-level class sizes?</h4>
        <h4>Humanities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100 level average class size: 15 students</li>
            <li>200 level average class size: 15 students</li>
            <li>300 level average class size: 10 students</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="plotly-div-4"></div>

        <p>So, for the humanities, the number stays the same for 100 and 200 level classes, but then drops by 5 students for the 300 levels.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Social Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100 level average class size: 22 students</li>
            <li>200 level average class size: 20 students</li>
            <li>300 level average class size: 13 students</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="plotly-div-5"></div>
        <p>So, for the humanities, the number drops each time when progressing to a higher level.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>100 level average class size: 17 students</li>
            <li>200 level average class size: 14 students</li>
            <li>300 level average class size: 10 students</li>
        </ul>

        <div id="plotly-div-6"></div>
        <p>So, for the the sciences, the number also drops each time when progressing to a higher level.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Social Science classes are the largest by average (despite having fewer classes and fewer enrollments). The Humanities classes and the Science classes have almost the same average class size.</p>

        <br>
        <br>



        <h4>Do average class sizes in these areas differ in the fall vs. spring?</h4>
        <h4>Humanities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enrollment in the fall: 14 students</li>
            <li>Enrollment in the spring: 14 students</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        <h4>Social Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enrollment in the fall: 18 students</li>
            <li>Enrollment in the spring: 17 students</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Enrollment in the fall: 14 students</li>
            <li>Enrollment in the spring: 14 students</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <br><br>
        <img src="images/bar4.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>
        <br>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: There is no difference in the overall averages of fall vs. spring semesters in any area.</p>


        <h4>What about total enrollment?</h4>
        <h4>Humanities:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the fall: 65451 students</li>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the spring: 61279 students</li>
        </ul>

        
        <br>
        <h4>Social Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the fall: 50318 students</li>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the spring: 46138 students</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Sciences:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the fall: 61197 students</li>
            <li>Total Enrollment in the spring: 52241 students</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="images/bar5.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Interesting! It seems as though more classes are taken in the fall than in the spring.
            <br>
            <br>There could be a number of reasons for this, for instance:
            <ul>
                <li>Number of students enrolled (fall includes more students who graduate in 3.5 or 4.5 years)</li>
                <li>Number of students studying abroad during each semester</li>
                <li>Tendency of students to take fewer classes and take classes off-campus as they progress</li>
                <li>Lastly, we are interested to know whether theses trends have changed over time. We'll focus on total enrollment.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        

        <img src="images/bar6.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/bar7.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/bar8.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>

        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Enrollments in science classes have always been higher in the fall. This is not necessarily true in the humanities and social sciences. Science enrollment in the fall seems to have increased more that in the spring following grade deflation, but the policy has not been around long enough to differentiate its impact from general noise in the data.</p>

        <h2>3. Are there any compelling stories about withdrawals at Wellesley?</h2>
        <h3>Are withdrawals increasing? Decreasing? Staying the same?</h3>

        <p>The total number of withdrawals throughout all the years is: <b>3424.0</b></p>
        <p>The percentage of toatl withdrawals throughout all the years is: <b>6.097%</b></p>

        <h4>Per year:</h4>
        2002: 114 <br>
        2003: 288 <br>
        2004: 433 <br>
        2005: 423 <br>
        2006: 390 <br>
        2007: 368 <br> 
        2008: 410 <br>
        2009: 382 <br>
        2010: 433 <br>
        2011: 183 <br>

        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/bar9.png" alt="Total classes per section" width=500>
        <p>Hmmm, this looks odd. By looking more closely at the data, I see that the data is not reliable before 2003 and after 2009, so we
            should ignore what happens there.</p>
        <p><b>Conlusion</b>: Withdrawls have remained fairly consistant throughout the years, although there was a dip in numbers in 
            2006. I initially thought that the increase after could be due to grade deflation being implemented at Wellesley, but that actually happened in 2004 so that is not the reason why. Therefore, we cannot be entirely sure why this is but perhaps classes offered were easier or students decided to stick them out more. </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Which departments have the highest proportion of withdrawals?</h3>
        
        <br>
        <div id="plotly-div-7"></div>
        <p> <b>Mathematics</b>, with 447 withdrawals since 2000. 
        </p>
        <br>


        <h3>Which course levels have the highest proportion of withdrawals?</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>100 Levels: 1458 withdrawals from 2000</li>
            <li>200 Levels: 1613 withdrawals from 2000</li>
            <li>300 Levels: 353 withdrawals from 2000</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <div id="plotly-div-11"></div>
        <br>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b>: Hmm, so we see a rise in widthrawals from 100 level classes to 200 level classes (probably because they are more difficult) and then 
            we see a sudden drop in the 300 levels (probably because by that point, you are invested in the subject and do not want to drop it).</p>

    </section>    

    <section>
        <h2>Final Conclusions</h2>
        <p>In general, we can see that:
        <ul>
            <li>The department with the smallest class sizes is the Swahili department</li>
            <li>The department with the largest class sizes is the Peace and Justice department</li>
            <li>Not only are there more humanities classes available but the science departments are growing at a faster rate!</li>
            <li>The Humanities have smaller class sizes than the Social Sciences or the Sciences.</li>
            <li>All 300 levels have smaller class sizes than 100 or 200 levels (in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Sciences)</li>
            <li>Enrollments in science classes have always been higher in the fall</li>
            <li>However, there are more classes that are taken in the fall semester, rather than the spring semester</li>
            <li>Withdrawls have remained fairly consistant throughout the years</li>
            <li>Most withrawls are from 200 level classes (not 100 or 300 levels)</li>
            <li>The Mathematics department has had the most withdrawls (almost 500) since 2000!</li>
