Notably, their model suggests 70-75% of people would eventually develop Alzheimer's by the age of 100 regardless of ApoE4 genotype (and 25-30% are resistant, regardless of genotype), but that ApoE4 variants shift the disease onset to occur significantly earlier (4 years earlier for heterozygous carriers, 13 years for homozygotes).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.14,Mental and behavioral;Nervous system,Complex/Other,Heterozygous,9343467;11950276;15123497;17428983,rs429358,4,chr19,45411941,C,http://evidence.pgp-hms.org/genomes?display_genome_id=e8e66303f6ee46171f9d576c6d3dab20e9d823d6&access_token=54898a848831c56c779964c59e730780
