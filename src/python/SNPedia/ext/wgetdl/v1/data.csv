size,impact,type,summary,id50,Benign,Homozygous,"Although one report speculated that this variant may cause dominant, early-onset sensorineural hearing loss, the findings lacked statistical significance. Notably, this gene is not a clinically tested gene and another of the eight variants reported by these authors (S797F) has since been observed in a PGP participant with no symptoms of hearing loss.",040,ProtCarrier,Heterozygous,"Reported to cause mild dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis gene, it may result in cystic fibrosis when combined with more severe variants.",180,Protective,Heterozygous,"Associated with increased risk of Barrett's esophagus and/or esophageal cancer. Our very rough estimate is that the increased risk may be around 4x (25% risk of Barrett's esophagus, assuming population average is 5%, and 1.2% lifetime risk of esophageal cancer compared to average .4% risk).",238,BenCarrier,Homozygous,"This nonsynonymous SNP is associated with Wolfram Syndrome (known as DIDMOAD), which is characterized by early-onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy, and deafness) and to adult Type Two Diabetes Mellitus.  The WFS1 gene maps to chromosome 4p16.3.  The variant has been shown to be statistically associated with type II diabetes in six UK studies and one study of Ashkenazi Jews (Sandhu, M., et al., Minton et al.).",320,Benign,Heterozygous,"Severe variants in this gene are associated with holoprosencephaly disorders when combined with loss-of-function variants in SHH. Haploinsufficiency was identified in some families with this condition. It is unclear how likely this variant is to occur in combination with an SHH variant, or what phenotypic effect the variant would have on its own.",412,PathCarrier,Heterozygous,"Some authors report this rare variant as a nonpathogenic polymorphism, others suggest it may cause renal glucosuria in a recessive manner when compound heterozygous with other pathogenic variants.",523,Pathogenic,Heterozygous,"This common variant may have a small pathogenic effect by contributing to cortisone reductase deficiency (a rare abnormality) when homozygous and combined with a serious pathogenic variant. The same authors have tested and ruled out a contribution to polycystic ovary syndrome (similar phenotype, more common disease).",6
