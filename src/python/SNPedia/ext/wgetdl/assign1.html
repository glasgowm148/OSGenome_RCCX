        <br> <!-- Section with a paragraph describing why I am taking CS110 -->
        <h2>Why am I taking CS110?</h2>
            <p> As a CS minor, I have taken many courses in the computer science
                department. However, I do not feel as I am as proficient in
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I would like to be. Therefore, I
                decided to take this course as a refresher and a way to expand
                my knowledge.
            </p>

        <br> <!-- Section with a paragraph describing my hobbies -->
        <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
        <p> One of my main hobbies is travelling. I especially enjoy
            travelling around Europe and Asia. Last year, my family and I
            went to Vietnam for Christmas and it was a fantastic experience.
            It was really interesting to see a completely different culture
            and especially interesting since I had learnt and read a lot
            about Vietnam in many of my classes at Wellesley. Over the next
            few years, I hope to keep travelling and learning more about the
            world around me.

            <br>
            <br> <!--breaks so that it looks good -->
            Another one of my hobbies is cooking. I especially enjoy making
            deserts, such as chocolate cake. However, since it is hard to
            cook elaborate deserts in Wellesley's kitchens, I have only had
            the chance to bake cookies with friends.
            <br>
