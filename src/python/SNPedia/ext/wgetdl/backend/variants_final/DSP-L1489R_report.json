    "Summary": "Unreported, rare and predicted to be damaging. Some dominant variants in this gene are reported to cause Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia -- this effect is contradicted by the presence of this variant in a healthy PGP participant, although penetrance is reported to be variable. Other recessive missense variants in this gene are reported to cause Skin Fragility-Woolly Hair Syndrome.",
