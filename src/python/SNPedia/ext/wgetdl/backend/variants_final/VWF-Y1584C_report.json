    "Summary": "This variant is associated with causing Type 1 von Willebrand disease in a dominant fashion. This hereditary defect in coagulation makes individuals more susceptible to bleeding. Not all carriers of the variant have the disease (incomplete penetrance); type O blood may also be a risk factor. A vWF antigen assay can confirm presence of the disease. Individuals are not usually treated with medication, but prophylactic measures are recommended before surgery and behavioral modification to avoid activities with a high risk of trauma (particularly head trauma) is recommended.",
