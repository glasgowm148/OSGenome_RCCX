    "Summary": "Implicated as causing Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/Cardiomyopathy in a dominant manner. However, it fails to segregate with disease in studied families and has also been seen in controls. It is unclear whether there is any significant enrichment for this variant in patients -- even if so, we estimate the increased risk of ARVD for a carrier of this variant to be quite low (less than .1%).",
