    "Summary": "Reported to cause Donnai-Barrow syndrome, a rare recessive disorder causing craniofacial abnormalities, vision and hearing loss, and intellectual disability. This report is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000033108/) and comes from de Ligt et al 2012 (PMID: 23033978), where this variant was seen in 1 of 100 patients studied with exome sequencing. It was potentially compound heterozygous with a de novo frameshift mutation. De Ligt et al don't mention controls, and ExAC data indicates this variant is relatively common in European ancestry (allele frequency of 0.17%, 1 in 300 are carriers). We would expect it to be very common in cases; but the variant was only seen once in 100 cases (no significant enrichment relative to ExAC data).",
