    "Summary": "Usually this variant is found in combination Y240C, forming the TPMT*3A variant. When alone, this variant produces the *3B variant. Both variants are associated with loss of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity. Inability to metabolize thiopurine drugs can lead to severe adverse reactions. Heterozygotes may be advised to take a reduced dosage due to reduced metabolism of the drug.",
