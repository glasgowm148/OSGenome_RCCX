    "Summary": "Danhauser et al. 2012 reported two individuals with aminoadipic aciduria, where this variant was found compound heterozygously in both. Although this variant's allele frequency is relatively high, it could be consistent with the proposed effect (recessive, and often asymptomatic). Additionally, the authors reported that the molecular cause of this metabolic issue was unknown as of their 2012 report, and there is no subsequent literature regarding this disease that confirms or contradicts their report.",
