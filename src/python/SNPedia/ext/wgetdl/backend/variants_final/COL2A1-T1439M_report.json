    "Summary": "Reported to cause spondyloperipheral dysplasia in a dominant fashion, impairing bone growth. Evidence for this is unclear, only a single paper from 2001 is referenced as supporting evidence], which reports finding the variant in a single affected family: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11746045  This effect is recorded in ClinVar by two sources: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17385/",
