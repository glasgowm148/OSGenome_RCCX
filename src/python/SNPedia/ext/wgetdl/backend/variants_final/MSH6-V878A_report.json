    "Summary": "In a screen of 288 individuals suspected of having HNPCC, Wu et al. 2001 found this variant in one individual who also had a rare MLH3 variant. The publication was mainly investigating a role for MLH3 (and not this gene), and merely refers to this variant as a MSH6 (without additional evidence). These observations match the variant's general allele frequency: over 1% of individuals are carriers. Although this has been listed in Clinvar as pathogenic, if it caused this disease with high penetrance it would be extremely well-established (since the variant is relatively common). Since this is not the case, that hypothesis is effectively disproven.",
