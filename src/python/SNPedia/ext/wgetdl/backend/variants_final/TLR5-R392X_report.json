    "Summary": "This variant is believed to impair the ability to generate an immune response to the flagella of the bacteria. It is weakly associated with an increased incidence of Legionnaires' Disease, p = 0.085, increased lifetime risk of disease ~0.88% (about twice average). The variant is also weakly associated with a reduced incidence of systemic lupus erythematosus, p = 0.165.",
