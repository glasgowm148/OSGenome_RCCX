    "Summary": "a.k.a Gly1057Asp, insulin receptor substrate-2 IRS2. The rs1805097(G) allele is associated with the Gly, and the (A) allele with Asp. \nA longevity study concluded that rs1805097(A;A) individuals were about twice as likely to live over 85 y/o (odds ratio 2.03, CI:1.39-2.99, p = .0003).
