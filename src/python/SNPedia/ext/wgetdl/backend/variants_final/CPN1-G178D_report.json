    "Summary": "This rare variant (around 1% allele frequency) is hypothesized to cause carboxypeptidase N deficiency in a recessive manner, especially if combined with a more severe variant. However the findings lack statistical sigificance: only a single case study of an affected individual links this variant to causing the disease. There aren\u2019t any follow-up in vitro studies testing whether this variant affects protein function.",
