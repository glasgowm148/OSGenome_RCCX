    "Summary": "Speculated to cause immunodeficiency in a patient with serious, repeated infections. A large set of patients was examined (1282) and this variant is not extremely rare (1.1% allele frequency), and so this single observation had no statistical significance. Additionally, if this phenotype is relatively rare (1% or less), then a strong disease effect in homozygotes should have resulted in many more homozygotes in the patient cohort. The lack of this observation casts significant doubt on any pathogenic hypothesis.",
