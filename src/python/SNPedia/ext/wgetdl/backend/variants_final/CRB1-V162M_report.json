    "Summary": "Very rare, reported to cause pigmented paravenous chorioretinal atrophy in a dominant manner, with variable effect -- some carriers asymptomatic, while another had vision loss in early 30s. Only one family reported. This variant had a strong association with the disease in that family, but different publication concluded the variant is benign and does not segregate with disease.",
