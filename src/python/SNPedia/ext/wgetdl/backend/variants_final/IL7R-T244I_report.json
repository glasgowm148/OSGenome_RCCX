    "Summary": "The reference genome variant for this allele has been associated with a slight increased risk of multiple sclerosis. Thus, this variant can be treated as a \"protective\" variant -- carriers of this variant are slightly less likely to have MS. Because the disease is rare and the effect of this variant is not very strong, the absolute decreased risk for carriers of this variant is less than .05% (less than 1 in 2000).",
