    "Summary": "Proposed to cause dominant dilated cardiomyopathy by Vatta et al 2003 (PMID: 14662268) based on observation in a single, small family. ExAC data indicates 1 out of 880 individuals carries this variant, while familial dilated cardiomyopathy has a prevalence of 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 individuals. Although penetrance for variants is incomplete, this allele frequency is much higher than the disease itself, and this hypothesis should be considered disproven.",
