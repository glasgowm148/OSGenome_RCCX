    "Summary": "Probably not pathogenic, although it may have a modifier effect in other diseases. Other disruptive variants in this gene are implicated in causing Joubert Syndrome and Meckel Syndrome in a recessive manner. Although this variant is somewhat rare (1.1% allele frequency) and Polyphen 2 predicts it to be disruptive, most reported disease-causing variants in the gene are more disruptive frameshift or nonsense mutations & occur upstream of this position.",
