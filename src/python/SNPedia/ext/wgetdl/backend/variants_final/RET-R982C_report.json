    "Summary": "Initially suspected of causing Hirschsprung\u2019s disease, this rare variant has been later reported as present in unaffected controls (allele frequency around 1%). Supporting a lack of effect: Panini et al. did not find loss of function effects seen in other variants, and Svensson et al. report unaffected relatives in a family who carried the same variant. OMIM lists it as reported to cause increased susceptibility, but there do not appear to be any statistically significant reports supporting this hypothesis.",
