    "Summary": "Uncertain, presumed benign. Seen in 2 out of 128 control chromosomes. Although  predicted to be damaging by Polyphen 2, recessive disease caused by disruption of this gene is presumed extremely rare and the only report of a disease-causing mutation in this gene was a frameshift (much more severe).",
