    "Summary": "Rare, tentatively classified as benign. Other variants in this gene are reported to cause polycystic kidney disease in a dominant manner, but these were more severe null mutations (nonsense or frameshift). In addition, this was seen in a PGP participant who has not reported a family history of the disease.",
