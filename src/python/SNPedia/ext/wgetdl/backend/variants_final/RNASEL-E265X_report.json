    "Summary": "Implicated in causing familial prostate cancer, but later findings fail to confirm this. The variant is equally common in the control population, which strongly contradicts the original hypothesis of a high penetrance effect. If the variant has any effect on prostate cancer it seems likely to be low penetrance (any evidence for this is, however, very weak).",
