    "Summary": "This variant was seen, along with other variants, in two cases of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis \u2014 however, the variant frequency in these cases does not significantly differ from later reported frequency of the variant in exome sequencing data (1.4%). If the variant were causal it would be significantly enriched in cases; instead, it is likely a polymorphism unrelated to the disease in these patients.",
