    "Summary": "Reported to cause Leber congenital amaurosis in a recessive manner, causing congenital vision loss. This effect is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000054426/) and comes from Asai-Coakwell 2013 (PMID: 23307924), who report seeing this variant compound heterozygous with another pathogenic variant in a single case out of 279 studied. According to ExAC data, about 1 in 6000 with European ancestry carry this variant.",
