    "Summary": "This variant is associated with hyperekplexia (a disorder of excessive startle reflect and stiffness), seen homozygously in a single family in a screen of 79 unrelated cases and not seen in 400 control chromosomes. This is not enough data to establish statistical significance, but the authors did find functional data supporting this variant as having an severe effect on the gene product.",
