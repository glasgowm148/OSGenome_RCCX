    "Summary": "Reported to cause holoprosencephaly, which causes facial and brain malformations. Submitted to ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000008705/), based on Ming et al 2002 (PMID: 11941477) and Rahimov et al 2006 (PMID: 17096318). Proposed inheritance pattern unclear \u2013 possibly dominant with variable penetrance. However, this pathogenic effect is strongly contradicted by ExAC allele frequency data which reports the variant has an allele frequency of 2.2% in African ancestry.",
