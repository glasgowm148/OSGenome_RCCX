    "Summary": "Although one report speculated that this variant may cause dominant, early-onset sensorineural hearing loss, the findings lacked statistical significance. Notably, this gene is not a clinically tested gene and another of the eight variants reported by these authors (S797F) has since been observed in a PGP participant with no symptoms of hearing loss.",
