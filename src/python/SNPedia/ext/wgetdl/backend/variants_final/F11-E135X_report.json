    "Summary": "Causes factor XI deficiency in a recessive manner, with symptoms of increased susceptibility to bruising, bleeding, and nosebleeds. This variant appears to be a well-established cause of the disease and is common in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. Asakai et al 1991 (PMID: 2052060) reports that about half of pathogenic variants found in patients with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are this variant, and the frequency of the variant is high in this ancestry (1 in 8 to 1 in 10 believed to be a carrier of this or another pathogenic variant).",
