JAK2-V617F,JAK2,"This well known variant is associated with myeloproliferative diseases: it is used as a diagnostic, providing supporting evidence in individuals who already have symptoms. It is seen as an acquired (not inherited) mutation, one of an accumulation of changes that leads to the development of these cancer-like diseases. It is possible to see this variant in whole genome data or genotyping from blood-derived DNA -- but it is unclear how to view the presence of the variant in individuals who don't have symptoms of the disease. Data from Nielsen et al. suggests that such carriers are at much higher risk of developing myeloproliferative disease or other blood cancer (with roughly 50% of still-living individuals developing these diseases by around 10 years after initial samples -- but these numbers are _extremely_ uncertain).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.00028,Blood;Cancer,Dominant,Heterozygous,15781101;15793561;15837627;15858187;15860661;15920007;16675710;16946305;19262599;20425436;21160067;21484303,rs77375493,4,chr9,5073770,T,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=c5c0c15780de720964e0c2ee195c8afbaeff0dc7
