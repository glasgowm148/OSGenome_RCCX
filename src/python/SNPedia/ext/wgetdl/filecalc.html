Questions:<br>
1. A. The formula to calculate the bytes needed per pixels is:<br>
# bytes for color table + # bytes for pixel color info = # bytes for total image file<br>
<br>
the number of bytes for color table is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
color_table_size = 129 * 8 = 1032<br>
<br>
# pixels x bit-depth / 8 = # bytes for pixel color info<br>
total_number_of_pixels = 700 * 450 = 315000<br>
number_of_bytes_for_pixel_color_info = (700*450)*8/8 = 315000<br>
<br>
So, now we add both of these to the first formula above and we get:<br>
answer = 315000 + 1032 = 316032 bytes<br>
<br>
B. Bytes needed to represent the pixels for the image:<br>
As seen above, the formula is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
Thus:<br>
answer = 129 * 8 = 1032 bytes<br>
<br>
2. A. If the picture uses 63 colors (6 bit-depth):<br>
<br>
the number of bytes for color table is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
color_table_size = 63 * 6 = 378<br>
<br>
# pixels x bit-depth / 8 = # bytes for pixel color info<br>
total_number_of_pixels = 700 * 450 = 315000<br>
number_of_bytes_for_pixel_color_info = (700*450)*6/8 = 236250<br>
<br>
<br>
So, now we add both of these to the first formula above and we get:<br>
answer = 236250 + 378 = 236628 bytes<br>
<br>
B. Bytes needed to represent the pixels for the image:<br>
As seen above, the formula is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
Thus:<br>
answer = 63 * 6 = 378 bytes<br>
<br>
2. A. If the picture uses 50 colors (6 bit-depth):<br>
<br>
the number of bytes for color table is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
color_table_size = 50 * 6 = 300<br>
<br>
# pixels x bit-depth / 8 = # bytes for pixel color info<br>
total_number_of_pixels = 700*450<br>
number_of_bytes_for_pixel_color_info = (700*450)*6/8 = 236250<br>
<br>
So, now we add both of these to the first formula above and we get:<br>
answer = 236250 + 300 = 236550 bytes<br>
<br>
B. Bytes needed to represent the pixels for the image:<br>
As seen above, the formula is:<br>
# colors x 3(bytes/color) = # bytes for color table<br>
Thus:<br>
answer = 50 * 6 = 300 bytes<br>
