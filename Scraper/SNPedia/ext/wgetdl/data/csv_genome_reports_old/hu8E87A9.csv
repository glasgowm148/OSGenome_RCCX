APOE-C130R,APOE,"This is generally known as the ApoE4 allele of ApoE and is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's. 20-25% of individuals are heterozygous for this variant, and 1-2% are homozygous. Data from Khachaturian et al. suggests an average 7% of all individuals developed Alzheimer's by the age of 80; when this is split by ApoE4 status: 10% of ApoE4 heterozygotes (3% increased attributable risk), 40% of ApoE4 homozygotes (33% increased attributable risk), and 5% of non-carriers (2% decreased attributable risk). Notably, their model suggests 70-75% of people would eventually develop Alzheimer's by the age of 100 regardless of ApoE4 genotype (and 25-30% are resistant, regardless of genotype), but that ApoE4 variants shift the disease onset to occur significantly earlier (4 years earlier for heterozygous carriers, 13 years for homozygotes).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.14,Mental and behavioral;Nervous system,Complex/Other,Heterozygous,9343467;11950276;15123497;17428983,rs429358,4,chr19,45411941,C
