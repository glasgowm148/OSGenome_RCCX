One report linked this variant to high triglycerides, but a later paper found a nearby SNP with similar association and suggests that both findings are caused by linkage to an undiscovered causal variant.",Low,Uncertain,Benign,0.35,Metabolism,Unknown,Homozygous,12764676;19364639,rs2293869,,chr8,55539395,T,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=8280b5e784be559f7e817261129575d5dc10c46e
CASP8-M1T,CASP8,"Probably benign. Although start codons can be extremely disruptive and this gene is implicated in a rare disease (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome), the allele frequency for this variant (2-3%) is high enough to contradict such a strong pathogenic effect. This may be because the gene has many other transcripts that do not include this position as exonic.",Low,Uncertain,Benign,0.031,Blood;Immune system,Unknown,Heterozygous,12353035,rs3769824,,chr2,202122956,C,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=8280b5e784be559f7e817261129575d5dc10c46e
