Notably, their model suggests 70-75% of people would eventually develop Alzheimer's by the age of 100 regardless of ApoE4 genotype (and 25-30% are resistant, regardless of genotype), but that ApoE4 variants shift the disease onset to occur significantly earlier (4 years earlier for heterozygous carriers, 13 years for homozygotes).",High,Well-established,Pathogenic,0.14,Mental and behavioral;Nervous system,Complex/Other,Heterozygous,9343467;11950276;15123497;17428983,rs429358,4,chr19,45411941,C,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=574e4bc14d5b9a7c308947fb11d6aa0f0418e971&access_token=5e335c7602b88ed6e52f194a94c67ef9
