TAS2R38-I296V,TAS2R38,"This variant is associated with ""taster"" status of PTC, along with 49P and 262A. Due to linkage disequilibrium, the independent effects of positions 296 and 262 is unclear. The presence of 49P confers taster status in a dominant fashion, but in the absence of 49P, the presence of 262A/296V is still positively associated with tasting PTC.",Low,Uncertain,Benign,0.46,Other,Unknown,Homozygous,12595690;20675712,rs10246939,,chr7,141672604,C,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=40cac89d574fc9bac7c6d4e3da396320a21fe8d1&access_token=156f3e00239c57ce20fd22962a84b946
