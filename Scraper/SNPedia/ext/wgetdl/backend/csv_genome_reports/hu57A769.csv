This variant is evolutionarily ancestral, and in vitro studies fail to support an impact of this variant on enzyme activity. Carney et al. instead implicate a 4 base deletion on the 5' of the GALT gene as being causal and linked to this variant. Galactosemia is typically screened and detected in infants and causes early, severe but nonspecific symptoms (digestive problems, lethargy, failure to thrive).",Low,Uncertain,Benign,0.072,"Mouth, liver, and digestive",Unknown,Heterozygous,10408771;11261429;19224951,rs2070074,,chr9,34649442,G,http://evidence.personalgenomes.org/genomes?display_genome_id=9033a767cbc2aa41793f0a1c0749a38883ca4901&access_token=895a428844bda9c6e0cdfc8f10728365
