    "Summary": "LabCorps has reported this as a \"likely pathogenic\" in ClinVar: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000030135/ Other missense variants in this gene are reported to cause familial hypercholesterolemia in a dominant manner. However, according to ExAC allele frequency data this variant is carried by 1 in 400 with European descent -- roughly equal to the prevalence of the disease. This seems to contradict the reported effect: if this variant *were* a significant cause of the disease, we would expect it to account for a large fraction of cases and be well-established in literature -- but this does not appear to be the case.",
