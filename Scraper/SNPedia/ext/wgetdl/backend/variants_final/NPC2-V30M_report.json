    "Summary": "Reported to cause seizures and epilepsy in a recessive manner, as recorded in ClinVar by the Developmental Genetics Unit; King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center. This assertion cites a supporting publication, Alazami et al 2015 (PMID: 25558065), which cite this as a mutation discovered through whole exome sequencing in a study of 143 consanguineous families with neurogenetic diagnoses. Other mutations in this gene are known to cause Neiman-Pick syndrome type C2 (a very rare variant), but neither of the affected siblings in the affected family had typical Neiman-Pick symptoms (progressive neurodegeneration or hepatosplenomegaly).",
