    "Summary": "Reported to cause syndromic microphthalmia, causing congenital abnormally small eyes and other malformations. This assertion is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000001197/) and comes from Pasutto et al 2007 (PMID: 17273977). Pasutto et al studied two consanguineous families and 13 additional cases with European ancestry; this variant was seen homozygously in one of the 13 alongside another missense variant in the same gene. It is unclear which of these two variants (if either) is causal, but the other variant (P90L) appears to be rarer, as it does not appear in ExAC data. In contrast, this variant has an allele frequency of 0.1% in European ancestry (1 in 500 are carriers). ExAC data strongly suggests that this variant, which is more common, is probably a non-causal coincidental observation.",
