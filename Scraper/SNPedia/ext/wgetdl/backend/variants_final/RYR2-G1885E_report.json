    "Summary": "Hypothesized to cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy when compound heterozygous with G1886S. However, this variant is quite common (2.4% in Europeans), as is G1886S (3.1% in Europeans), and about 1 in 700 are compound heterozygous. This is highly discordant with a disease prevalence of 1 in 2500 to 5000, and notably G1886S is reported in ClinVar as benign. We should consider the original hypothesis disproven.",
