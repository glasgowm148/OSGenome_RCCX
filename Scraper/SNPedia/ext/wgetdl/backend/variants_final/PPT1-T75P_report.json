    "Summary": "Reported to cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a neurodegenerative disorder, in a recessive manner. This assertion is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000009451/), and comes from Mitchison et al 1998 (PMID: 9425237). Mitchison et al report this variant was seen in 8 of 22 patients studied, once homozygous and others compound heterozygous.",
