    "Summary": "Syrris, et al. 2007 reported this in one patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (no familial data), and implied a high penetrance hypothesis. Posch, et al. 2008 found it in 13 out of 538 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and only 3 of 617 control individuals (p = 0.009); while this may seem significant, the variant is far more common (carried by ~1 in 200) than the diseases ARVC (1 in 2000-5000) and DCM (1 in 2500). This disproves a high penetrance hypothesis, and Posch et al. merely speculate that the variant \"may represent a ... susceptibility variant\". (No later studies are published confirming this speculation.)",
