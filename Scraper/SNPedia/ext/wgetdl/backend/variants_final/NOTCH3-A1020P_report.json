    "Summary": "Probably nonpathogenic. Reported by Scheid et al. as possibly causing CADASIL in a dominant manner, but an immediate follow-up from Quattrone et al. disagreed with this hypothesis, pointing to the presence of the variant in their own controls and the high allele frequency for the variant seen in dbSNP data.",
