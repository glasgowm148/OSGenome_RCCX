    "Summary": "Study of a single family with X-linked immunodeficiency implicated this variant as causal when combined with XIAP-G466X. The authors' hypothesis is that either variant alone has much less effect, if any. Because 2% of males carry this variant, it is very unlikely that the variant alone has any severe effect.",
