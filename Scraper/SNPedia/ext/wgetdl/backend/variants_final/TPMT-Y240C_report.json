    "Summary": "Alone, this variant is known as TPMT*3C -- but often, especially in Caucasians, it is found together with another nonsynonymous variant (A154T) to produce the TPMT*3A variant. Both variants are associated with loss of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) activity, although *3C is milder than *3A. Inability to metabolize thiopurine drugs can lead to severe adverse reactions. Heterozygotes may be advised to take a reduced dosage due to reduced metabolism of the drug.",
