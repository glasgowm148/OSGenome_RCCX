    "Summary": "One report suggested that this rare variant (0.9% allele frequency) could be associated with hyperprolinemia and, through this, associated with increased susceptibility to schizophrenia and/or schizoaffective disorder. However, this finding completely lacked statistical significance, and both reported cases were also associated with other potentially causal variants. A later functional study found only a mild functional effect on enzyme activity (78-90% of wildtype activity).",
