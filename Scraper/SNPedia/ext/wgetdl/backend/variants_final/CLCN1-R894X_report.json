    "Summary": "Causes myotonia congenita in a recessive manner, delayed relaxation of the muscles and rigidity. May also cause symptoms in a dominant manner with low penetrance (sometimes subclinical symptoms reported). Based on allele frequency (1 in 500 are carriers) vs. disease prevalence (1-10 in 100,000), we conclude the penetrance for the disease in heterozygous carriers, if true, is either very low penetrances (< 1%) and/or very underdiagnosed.",
