    "Summary": "This variant is associated with an increased susceptibility to Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Assuming an overall prevalence of 0.5% for IBD, this variant implies an increased attributable risk of 2% (5x increased risk, for an overall risk of 2.5% of IBD for people with this variant).",
