    "Summary": "Singh et al. 2009 studied a large family with febrile seizures, linking this region as causal. Then, analyzing a panel of 92 patients with childhood febrile seizures, and 109 Dravet cases (total of 201 patients), they saw 3 carriers of this variant (once in former, twice in latter), and not it in 562 Caucasian control chromosomes (281 individuals). Neither patient nor control findings have a statistically significant difference the variant frequency according to ExAC data (where 1 in 173 are carriers). This paper was proposing a high penetrance hypothesis, but if this were true we would see a dramatic enrichment of the variant in patients.",
