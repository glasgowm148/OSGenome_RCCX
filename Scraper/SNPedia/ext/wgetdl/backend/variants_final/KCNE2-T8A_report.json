    "Summary": "Found in about 1% of individuals, probably has no clinically significant effect. One group proposed that this variant may cause increased susceptibility to drug-induced arrhythmia, but this conclusion is not supported (and perhaps slightly contradicted) by their reported observations of the variant in clinical cases.",
