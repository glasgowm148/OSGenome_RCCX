    "Summary": "Severe variants in this gene are associated with holoprosencephaly disorders when combined with loss-of-function variants in SHH. Haploinsufficiency was identified in some families with this condition. It is unclear how likely this variant is to occur in combination with an SHH variant, or what phenotypic effect the variant would have on its own.",
