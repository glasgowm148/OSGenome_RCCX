    "Summary": "Probably benign. This variant was implicated as causing Refsum Disease in a recessive manner, but a subsequent publication noted that all instances were linked with other explanatory mutations. The high allele frequency of this variant in the population (7-13%) contradicts a pathogenic hypothesis.",
