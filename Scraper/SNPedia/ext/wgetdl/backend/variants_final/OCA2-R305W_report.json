    "Summary": "This variant is associated with eye color, as is OCA2 Arg419Gln. Individuals with this variant are more likely to have brown/black eyes (as opposed to blue/gray or green/hazel). Other variants in this gene are associated with oculocutaneous albinism (albinism which involves skin and eyes).",
