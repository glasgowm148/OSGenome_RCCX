    "Summary": "Reported to cause North American Indian childhood cirrhosis in a recessive manner, as recorded in ClinVar by OMIM. This comes from Chagnon et al 2002 (PMID: 12417987) who found this homozygous in all five affected families studied. All cases were Ojibway-Cree children in Quebec with a shared haplotype indicating a common ancestor, and may have been linked to a different causal variant. ExAC data reports that this variant is fairly common in Latino ancestry (allele frequency of 1.9%, ~1 in 3,000 are homozygous). This strongly contradicts the variant as causing this disease, which is extremely rare and has only been described in aboriginal children in northwestern Quebec.",
