    "Summary": "This variant shows pseudodeficiency for production of FAH protein which is connected with hereditary tyrosinemia type I. Pseudodeficiency was confirmed with site-directed mutagenesis and expression in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The allelic frequency in 516 Norwegian controls was 0.022. ",
