    "Summary": "Reported to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a dominant manner, as recorded in ClinVar by OMIM. This assertion comes from a couple publications, including van Es 2009 (PMID: 19153377) and Millecamps et al (PMID: 20577002). Van Es et al. reported a large family with disease segregating with this variant. Millecamps et al 2010, according to OMIM, saw this variant in 2 out of 162 families. However, ExAC reports that this variant has an allele frequency of 0.165% in European ancestry. Observations by Millecamps et al have no statistically significant enrichment, and van Es et al may have merely observed linkage to a different pathogenic variant on the same chromosome. The incidence of familial ALS is around 1 in 10,000, according to ExAC data carriers are more than 10x as common as the disease itself: 1 in 300 with European ancestry carry this variant.",
