    "Summary": "Several publications asserted this variant caused familial medullary thyroid cancer in a dominant manner. However, a 2010 publication by Erlic et al. examined a larger set of controls, finding the variant no more common in cases than it was in controls. These authors conclude that the variant is not a serious cause of the disease, although they could not rule out a small effect on risk.",
