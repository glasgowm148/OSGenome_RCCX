    "Summary": "A study in an Asian population associates this variant with increased susceptibility to anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease (anti-GBM), an autoimmune disease that causes bleeding, lung, and kidney disease. Even for carriers of this variation, anti-GBM is quite rare -- this variant only increases absolute risk for the disease by 0.1-0.2%. A much weaker finding seems to correlate homozygosity for the variant with increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); if true, the amount of increased risk due to the variant is unclear.",
