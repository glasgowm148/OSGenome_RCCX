    "Summary": "Reported to cause Stargardt disease in a recessive manner, causing juvenile macular degeneration and vision loss. This effect is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM, and comes from Rozet et al 1998 (PMID: 9781034), who reported seeing this variant compound heterozygous in a patient from of 55 affected families. However, in ExAC data, this variant has an allele frequency of 0.42% of European ancestry \u2013 which means 1 in 118 individuals are carriers. An observation of 1 in 55 is likely a chance observation; a causal variant should be more significantly enriched in patients. In contrast, Rivera et al 2000 (PMID: 10958763) reported no enrichment for this variant in patients. (c.f. ABCA4 Ala1038Val, which ExAC reports 0.42% frequency in Europeans, had an allele frequency of 9% in Rivera et al's patients.)",
