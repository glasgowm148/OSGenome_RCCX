    "Summary": "This variant is implicated in partial and profound biotinidase deficiency. Alone, this variant is estimated to have a 52% loss of enzymatic activity. This variant is often found with A171T, and together they are reported to cause profound deficiency. Notably there is a report of asymptomatic double-mutant adults, so symptoms may have variable penetrance. This variant is found compound heterozygously with more serious mutations in cases of partial biotinidase deficiency.",
