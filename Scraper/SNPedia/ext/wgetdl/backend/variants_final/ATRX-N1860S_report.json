    "Summary": "Proposed to cause X-linked alpha thalassemia intellectual disability syndrome. This assertion was recorded by OMIM in ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000012490/), made by Gibbons et al 1995 (PMID: 7697714) where the variant was seen once in 25 cases. However, ExAC allele frequency data indicates 1 in 160 men carry this variant \u2013 extremely discordant with the proposed effect \u2013 and so this hypothesis is strongly contradicted.",
