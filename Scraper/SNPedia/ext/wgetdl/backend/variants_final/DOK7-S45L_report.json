    "Summary": "This variant was seen as a compound heterozygote (with either P376PfsX30 or P469H) in two individuals with congenital myasthenic syndromes (out of a screen of 200). Other mutations in this gene are associated with the syndrome, but there are insufficient controls to establish this variant in particular as significant.",
