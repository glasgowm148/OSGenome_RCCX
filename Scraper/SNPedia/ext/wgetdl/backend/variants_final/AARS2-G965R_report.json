    "Summary": "Reported to cause progressive leukoencephalopathy in a recessive manner, causing severe neurogeneration begining in young adulthood. This effect is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000132555/), and comes from Dallabona et al 2014 (PMID: 24808023) who found this variant in one of 11 patients, compound heterozygous with another putative pathogenic variant.",
