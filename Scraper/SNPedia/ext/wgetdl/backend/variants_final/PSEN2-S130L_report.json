    "Summary": "Occasional observations report this in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and other variants in this gene cause early-onset AD. One group speculates an association with dilated cardiomyopathy. However, a functional study found no abnormal behavior (Walker et al.) and none of these studies showed statistically significant associations of the variant with either of these diseases.",
