    "Summary": "Several different genetic testing groups report this variant causes Carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome type I, as recorded in ClinVar (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000008145/). ExAC allele frequency data appears to contradict this, as the allele frequency is relatively high: according to their data, 1 in 8,000 with European descent are expected to be homozygous. This seems to be more common than the disease itself, and would seem to contradict this reported effect. However, ExAC data also indicates this may be a low-quality site for sequencing (which may affect ExAC data, and other exome or whole genome data).",
