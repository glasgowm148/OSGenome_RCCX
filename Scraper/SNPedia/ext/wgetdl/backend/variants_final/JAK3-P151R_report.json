    "Summary": "Reported in ClinVar to cause Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease (aka \"bubble boy disease\"). However the variant is carried by nearly 1 in 100 individuals with European ancestry, and 1 in 12,000 are predicted to be homozygous. The disease is extremely rare -- highest estimate is 1 in 50,000 -- the high frequency of this variant means it cannot be a cause of this disease.",
