    "Summary": "Presumed benign. Although this variant was implicated in causing ectodermal dysplasia in a recessive manner in two Pakistani families (one of which was large and consanguineous), GET-Evidence reports that the variant has been seen in 5 out of 114 random control chromosomes. This strongly contradicts a severe pathogenic effect.",
