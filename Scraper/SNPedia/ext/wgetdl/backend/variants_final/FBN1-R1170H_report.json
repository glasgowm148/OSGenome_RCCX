    "Summary": "Reported to cause a \"subdiagnostic variant\" of Marfan syndrome as recorded by OMIM in ClinVar. This comes from Montgomery et al 1998 (PMID: 9837823) who report studying this in a single affected family. However, there aren't later publications confirming this variant as causal, at it is quite common. 1 in 500 are expected to carry this, while the Marfan syndrome affects only 1 in 5,000.",
