    "Summary": "Reported to increase risk of Cowden disease, although this was already contradicted by a prior report of it as a non-pathogenic polymorphism. The report claiming a pathogenic effect (Ni et al.) may have had errors in analysis, and their observation of the variant in patients isn't different from the frequency of the variant in ExAC data.",
