    "Summary": "Reported to cause high penetrance colorectal cancer (MUTYH-Associated Polyposis) in a recessive manner (i.e. if there are two copies, or if combined with another damaging variant in the same gene). This effect is consistently reported to ClinVar by several sources (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/5294/), indicating the evidence supporting this effect is fairly strong.",
