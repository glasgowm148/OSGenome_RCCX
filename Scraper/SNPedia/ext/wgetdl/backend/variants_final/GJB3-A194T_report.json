    "Summary": "Reported to cause deafness when combined with a pathogenic mutation in another gene (GJB2). This effect is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000006866/) and is reported by Liu et al 2009 (PMID: 19050930) who found this variant heterozygous in one of 108 Chinese patients already carrying a putatively pathogenic a GJB2 variant. However, in ExAC data this variant has an allele frequency of 0.72% in east asian ancestry. Thus, 1 in 70 are expected to carry it heterozygously in this population; matching Liu et al's observation in cases. Due to high allele frequency, and lack of enrichment for the variant cases, the proposed effect should be considered disproven.",
