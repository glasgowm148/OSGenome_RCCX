    "Summary": "This variant represents the PiS variant in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency where a homozygous individual has 60% enzymatic activity. This variant alone is unlikely to much effect, but 3-4% of heterozygotes are compound heterozygous with the more severe PiZ variant, which is associated with an increased risk of emphysema and COPD.",
