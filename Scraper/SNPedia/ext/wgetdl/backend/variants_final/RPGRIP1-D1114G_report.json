    "Summary": "This variant is hypothesized to cause Leber's Congenital Amaurosis in a recessive manner (causing severe vision loss and blindness), but stastical significance cannot be established without any observations of allele frequency in controls. This variant is a missense and predicted by Polyphen 2 to have a benign effect, while other causal variants implicated in this gene are severe truncating variants (nonsense or frameshift mutations).",
