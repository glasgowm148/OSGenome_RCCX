    "Summary": "This variant has been implicated in causing osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome in a recessive manner. The gene is strongly implicated in causing the disease, but an insufficient number of controls means this variant's observation lacks statistical significance. The condition manifests in childhood with early onset osteoporosis and eye problems.",
