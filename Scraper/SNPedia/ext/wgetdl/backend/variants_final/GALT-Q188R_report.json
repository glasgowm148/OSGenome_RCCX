    "Summary": "This variant causes classic galactosemia in a recessive manner (when homozygous or combined with another disease-causing variant). This is a metabolic disorder where individuals are unable to metabolize the sugar galactose. Treatment consists of strict dietary avoidance of lactose and galactose. Without treatment children develop permanent and eventually fatal health problems, and even when treated some individuals still have neurological impairment.",
