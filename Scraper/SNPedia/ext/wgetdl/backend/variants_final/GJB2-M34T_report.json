    "Summary": "Several labs have reported in ClinVar that this causes deafness in a recessive manner: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/17000/ This variant seems to be \"mild\", with a stronger effect when combined with a more severe variant. The variant is relatively common: according to ExAC data, 1 in 40 with European ancestry (and 1 in 25 Finnish) are carriers of this variant. L\u00f6pp\u00f6nen et al 2012 report that homozygotes for the variant have mild to moderate hearing impairment.",
