    "Summary": "Implicated in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, but published observations lack statistical significance. Other variants at this position have strong evidence, but this variant had less severe consequences in functional studies. Also contradicting a pathogenic hypothesis is the fact that it has been seen in a presumed-healthy PGP individual (African American) and in one other presumed-healthy public genome (Nigerian).",
