    "Summary": "This variant is predicted to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (paraplegin type) in a recessive manner. Other downstream frameshift mutations in this gene have been implicated in causing the disease. Age of onset is usually in adulthood (~25 years of age), and is characterized by progressive bilateral lower limb weakness and spasticity.",
