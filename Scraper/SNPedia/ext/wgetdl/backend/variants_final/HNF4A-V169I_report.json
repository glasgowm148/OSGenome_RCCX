    "Summary": "Reported to cause maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY, or monogenic diabetes). This effect is reported as \"likely pathogenic\" in ClinVar by LabCorp (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000030023/). However, according to ExAC this variant is much more frequent in south asian ancestry, where it has an allele frequency of 1.5% (about 1 in 35 carry the variant). This is very strong evidence against it causing this disease, and the reported effect should be considered disproven.",
