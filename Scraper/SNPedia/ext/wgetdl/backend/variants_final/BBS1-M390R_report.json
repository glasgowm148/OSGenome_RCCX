    "Summary": "This variant is implicated in causing Bardet-Biedl syndrome; found mostly in Europeans, this is the most frequent Bardet-Biedl syndrome mutation. However homozygousity at this locus does not appear to be sufficient for causing the syndrome. Beales et al. supports the need for an additional mutation. Based on their data, we estimate that roughly 1 in 10 individuals homozygous for BBS1 M390R develop Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (which has a ~1:150,000 frequency in the population).",
