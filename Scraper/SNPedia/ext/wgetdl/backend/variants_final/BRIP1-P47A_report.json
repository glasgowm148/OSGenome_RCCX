    "Summary": "Some sources report this in ClinVar as a likely pathogenic cause of familial breast cancer and ovarian cancer (acting in a dominant manner); however others report it as having uncertain significance (unclear whether it is or is not a cause): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/4736/  The only publication linked is from 2001, which found this heterozygous in 1 of 86 cases and not in 200 controls \u2013 this has no statistical significance, and no further study of that patient's family was done.",
