    "Summary": "Ehlermann et al. 2008 reported seeing this in one hypertrophic cardiomyopathy case in a screen of 158 patients, and not in 430 controls (they reported it as novel). Similarly, Rodr\u00edguez-Garc\u00eda et al. 2010 saw it once in 130 cases and not in 200 controls. However, ExAC data reports an allele frequency of 0.15% in Europeans \u2013 1 in 330 carriers. Both reported findings are consistent with ExAC data (and not significantly different from it). If this variant played any causal role (even one with reduced, but notable penetrance), it would have been seen much more frequently in patients; as no such enrichment was found, the pathogenic hypothesis is strongly disproven.",
