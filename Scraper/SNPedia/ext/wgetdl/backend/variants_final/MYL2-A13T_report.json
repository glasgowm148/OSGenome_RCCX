    "Summary": "This rare variant is implicated in causing late-onset familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The variant has been found in five affected Caucasian individuals (in four families), but affected non-carriers and unaffected carriers have also been observed. No statistically significant enrichment of this variant in cases vs. controls has been shown.",
