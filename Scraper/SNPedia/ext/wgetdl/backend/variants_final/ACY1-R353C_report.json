    "Summary": "Reported to cause Aminoacylase 1 deficiency in a recessive manner. This metabolic defect was first described by Van Coster, et al. 2005 and Sass et al. 2006. This variant was recognized as relatively common (ExAC reports 0.37% allele frequency in European data), but was seen homozygous in an affected individual, and compound heterozygous in another patient by Sass et al. 2007.",
