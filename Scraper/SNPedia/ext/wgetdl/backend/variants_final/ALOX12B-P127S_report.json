    "Summary": "This variant was found heterozygously in autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis in two Turkish siblings, although the second mutation was not found. Later, Lesueur et al. observe that this variant has a 4% frequency in their North African controls and is likely just a rare SNP.",
