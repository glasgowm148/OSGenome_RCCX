    "Summary": "Reported to cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type II in a dominant manner, causing hypertension, hyperkalemia, increased renal salt reabsorption, and impaired K+ and H+ excretion. One family is reported carrying this variant, but this appears to lack statistical significance. Only a handful of families have been reported with this genetic disease, and the variant is extremely rare.",
