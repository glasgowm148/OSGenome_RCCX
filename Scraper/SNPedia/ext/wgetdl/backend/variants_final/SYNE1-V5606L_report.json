    "Summary": "Tentatively classified as benign, although Polyphen 2 predicts a damaging effect. Other recessive variants in this gene are reported to cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy or spinocerebellar ataxia, but these are generally more severe and/or far earlier in the peptide sequence.",
