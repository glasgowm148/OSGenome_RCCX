    "Summary": "Hypothesized to cause common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) in a dominant manner, but observations lack statistical significance and the frequency of people having this variant (0.8%) is much higher than the prevalence of the disease (0.002%). If this variant is associated with increased risk, carriers of this variant must still have an extremely low chance of developing CVID. Other genetic factors may be necessary.",
