    "Summary": "Rare and unreported, tentatively evaluated as benign. Some severe mutations in this gene cause Chediak-Higashi syndrome (a severe genetic disorder causing albinism, neuropathy, and life-threatening susceptibility to bacterial infections), but this disease is rare and there are many other genomes with rare missense polymorphisms.",
