    "Summary": "Reported to cause corticosteroid deficiency in a recessive fashion, a disease which can cause fatigue after exertion. This variant was reported by Van Baelen et al 1982 (PMID: 7061486), and recorded in ClinVar by OMIM (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000018495/). Van Baelen et al described this variant as \"transcortin Leuven\", who reported the variant protein product had 3.6-fold reduced affinity for cortisol at 28C.",
