    "Summary": "Associated with Paget's Disease of the Bone in a dominant manner, which causes abnormal growth of bone. Many carriers are asymptomatic, others present with bone pain, deformity, fractures, and associated complications (including hearing loss, osteoarthritis, and nerve compression). Susceptibility is related to age, with most (but not all) of older carriers (>60 years) reported to have symptoms of the disease.",
