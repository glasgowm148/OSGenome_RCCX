    "Summary": "Reported to cause osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome in a recessive manner. This effect is recorded in ClinVar by OMIM, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000033260/). This comes from Narumi et al 2010 (PMID: 20034086), who found this variant compound heterozygous in a Japanese patient. Although the report didin't establish statistical significance, the variant may be very rare. ExAC has no allele frequency for the variant. This rarity would be consistent with the proposed effect, as is the the highly disruptive nature of the variant (nonsense mutation).",
