    "Summary": "Associated with increased risk of Barrett's esophagus and/or esophageal cancer. Our very rough estimate is that the increased risk may be around 4x (25% risk of Barrett's esophagus, assuming population average is 5%, and 1.2% lifetime risk of esophageal cancer compared to average .4% risk).",
