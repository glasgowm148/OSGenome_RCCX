    "Summary": "This is the second most common variant that causes Cystic Fibrosis. It causes Cystic Fibrosis if homozygous or combined with another severely disruptive variant in this gene (e.g. F508Del). Severe variants in this gene can also cause bilateral absence of the vans deferens (causing male infertility) when combined with a less disruptive variant.",
