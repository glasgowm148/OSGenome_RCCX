    "Summary": "One  group reported a sporadic hemangioblastoma case with this variant, a tumor commonly found in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. However, the finding had no statistical significance and three other relatives with the variant were unaffected -- the variant might be coincidental, or may cause VHL disease with lowered penetrance. VHL disease is typically highly penetrant, dominantly inherited and causes multiple tumors. Also found in combination with another variant (L188V) in another family with VHL disease; both variants were inherited together, and functional studies implicate the other variant as more disruptive.",
