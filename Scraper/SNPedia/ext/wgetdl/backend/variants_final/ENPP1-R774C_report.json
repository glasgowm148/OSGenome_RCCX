    "Summary": "Tentatively classified as benign. Initially reported as a recessive cause of infantile arterial calcification, but with no statistical significance. Other variants have been implicated as causal in these cases this variant. 5% allele frequency in caucasians contradicts this variant as having any highly pathogenic effect.",
