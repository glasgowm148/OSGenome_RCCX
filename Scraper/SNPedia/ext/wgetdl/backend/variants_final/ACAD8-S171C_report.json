    "Summary": "This variant (a.k.a S149C) was found as a compound heterozygote (with M130T) in a male newborn of European descent with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (identified by newborn screening). Lack of controls means that significance cannot be established and allele frequency cannot be estimated. Oglesbee et al. comment that IBD-deficiency may be relatively benign, most cases identified by newborn screening have remained asymptomatic, but Ferreira et al. report a symptomatic individual homozygous for this variant.",
