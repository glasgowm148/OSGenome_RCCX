ACAD8-S171C,1,"This variant (a.k.a S149C) was found as a compound heterozygote (with M130T) in a male newborn of European descent with isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (identified by newborn screening). Lack of controls means that significance cannot be established and allele frequency cannot be estimated. Oglesbee et al. comment that IBD-deficiency may be relatively benign, most cases identified by newborn screening have remained asymptomatic, but Ferreira et al. report a symptomatic individual homozygous for this variant.",low,uncertain,pathogenic,carrier,1.8,cancer
ADA-K80R,2,"This variant has a 3.5% allele frequency in 1000 genomes data. Although OMIM links this to disease, the paper they reference uses in vitro data to conclude that this is a functionally neutral polymorphism.",low,likely,benign,carrier,6.4,cancer
ARSA-N350S,3,This common variant (HapMap 24.1% allele frequency) causes a loss of a glycosylation site (affecting the size of the protein when studied with gel electrophoresis) but does not affect enzyme activity or stability.,low,well-established,benign,-,18,metabolism

C3-R102G,5,"This variant (also called C3F) is common in Europeans (10.2% allele frequency), and is associated with age-related macular degeneration. In the US, 1.5% of adults over 40 have the disease, but the incidence increases strongly with age (>15% in women over 80). Assuming an average lifetime risk of ~10%, heterozygous individuals have a ~13% risk and homozygous have ~20%.",moderate,likely,pathogenic,-,15,metabolism
CACNA1S-L458H,6,Common polymorphism,low,likely,benign,-,27,metabolism
CASP8-M1T,7,"Probably benign. Although start codons can be extremely disruptive and this gene is implicated in a rare disease (autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome), the allele frequency for this variant (2-3%) is high enough to contradict such a strong pathogenic effect. This may be because the gene has many other transcripts that do not include this position as exonic.",low,uncertain,benign,-,3.1,metabolism
COL5A2-P460S,8,"Tentatively benign. Although predicted to be damaging by Polyphen 2, this variant is seen in 2 out of 62 PGP & public genomes.

FIG4-K278Shift,14,This variant is predicted to cause a frameshift and may cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 4J in an autosomal recessive manner.

FUT2-W154X,15,"This recessive protective variant confers resistance to norovirus (which causes stomach flu). 20% of Caucasians and Africans are homozygous for this variant and are ""non-secretors"": they do not express ABO blood type antigens in their saliva or mucosal surfaces. Most strains of norovirus bind to these antigens in the gut, and so this non-secretor status confers almost total resistantance to most types of norovirus. There are notable exceptions, some strains of norovirus bind a different target and are equally infectious for secretors and non-secretors.",moderate,well-established,protective,carrier,49,metabolism
HFE-H63D,16,"There have been some hypotheses that this variant contributes to causing hereditary hemochromatosis, possibly as a compound heterozygote, but some others treat it as a polymorphism. Cys282Tyr is the classic causal variant and itself has very low penetrance. Mouse studies indicates this variant has a similar but weaker effect; if it has any effect at all its penetrance may be quite low and/or require modifier alleles.",low,uncertain,pathogenic,carrier,11,metabolism
IL7R-T244I,17,"The reference genome variant for this allele has been associated with a slight increased risk of multiple sclerosis. Thus, this variant can be treated as a ""protective"" variant -- carriers of this variant are slightly less likely to have MS. Because the disease is rare and the effect of this variant is not very strong, the absolute decreased risk for carriers of this variant is less than .05% (less than 1 in 2000).",low,likely,protective,-,21,metabolism
KCNJ11-K23E,18,"This variant is associated with decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. It is unclear whether this variant has additive effects, or acts in a dominant or recessive manner.

LYST-R159K,20,"Rare and unreported, tentatively evaluated as benign.

MTRR-I49M,23,"This common variant (HapMap allele frequency of 31.3%) in a protein involved in folate (B9) and cobalamin (B12) metabolism and is often reported as ""MTRR I22M"" (an alternative transcript position). Mothers homozygous for this variant are associated with having around a increased chance of a child with Down syndrome (risk of 0.4%, average risk in population is 0.25%). Notably, age plays a far larger role in the rate of Down syndrome (risk is 4.5% for a mother 45-years-of-age), and it is unknown how this variant may combine with the effect of age. There are conflicting reports associating this variant with incidence of neural tube defects, possibly when combined with MTHFR A222V.",low,likely,pathogenic,carrier,45,cardio

rs1544410,31,rs1544410 is a Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) single nucleotide polymorphism.

SERPINA1-E288V,33,"This variant represents the PiS variant in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency where a homozygous individual has 60% enzymatic activity.

SERPINA1-E366K,34,"This is also called the ""Pi Z"" or ""Z"" allele. When homozygous (acting in a recessive manner) this variant is the major cause of severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (95% of cases) which often leads to emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and liver disease in adults and children. Heterozygosity for this variant may also be associated with increased rate of lung or liver problems, especially when combined with another variant with reduced function (compound heterozygous).",high,well-established,pathogenic,carrier,1.2,metabolism
