        Once upon a time, a woman <span class='adverb'>adverb</span> went
        to where she saw a man named <span class='noun'>name</span> who was
        <span class='adjective'>adjective</span>. The first thing she noticed about
        <span class='noun'>name</span> was his <span class='adjective'>adjective</span>
        <span class='object'>object</span>. She thought <span class='noun'>name</span>
        seemed very cute and friendly, so she decided to talk to
        <span class='noun'>name</span>. It was love at first sight, but then they both
        died. The end.
