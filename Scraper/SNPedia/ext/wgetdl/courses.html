                        "This course explains the basics of how the Internet works
                        and how to build a website. Topics include client-server
                        architecture; structuring Web pages with HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript; the representation of colors, images, and sound
                        on the computer; encryption; cookies; and CGI forms. We also
                        discuss accessibility, copyright, intellectual property, and
                        critical thinking in the context of the Internet. The required
                        project models most phases of the standard software lifecycle.
                        Students are introduced to programming by building an interactive
                        website using JavaScript. Students are required to attend an
                        additional 70-minute discussion section each week."

                        of computer systems that possess and acquire knowledge and

                        "This course focuses on the reciprocal influences of the
                        media on politics and the public. We assess the media as
                        a source of democratic accountability, civic education,
                        expert opinion, editorial signaling, entertainment,
                        propaganda, and political engagement. We discuss how
                        journalism norms, economic pressures and ideology may
                        bias news content. Besides traditional media, we examine
                        Internet news, comedy programs, partisan, opinionated
                        and international news sources, ads, blogs, YouTube,
                        Twitter, and other social networking sites and their
                        impact. The aim of the course is to develop critical
                        understanding of political information."

                        "This course will examine the role of political leadership
                        in the U.S. policymaking process, with a particular
                        emphasis on foreign policy. We will examine different
                        theories of political leadership, and apply them to
                        understand how actors both inside and outside of government
                        attempt to shape political outcomes. Along the way, we
                        will explore what is leadership, who gets to exercise
                        leadership, how bureaucratic structures can constrain or
                        enable leadership, and whether leadership is synonymous
                        with policy effectiveness. Through meetings with
                        representatives from interest groups, think tanks, and
                        legislative and executive institutions, students will
                        observe and critically analyze how political actors
                        conceive of power and influence in real world settings.
                        Our primary focus will be on how foreign policy decisions
                        get made, but students are welcome to explore other
                        related areas of public policy."

                    <p class="course_descriptions">
                        "Power transitions are among the most dangerous moments
                        in international politics. Scholars argue that when new
                        great powers rise, they threaten the interests of other
                        states, provoking balancing coalitions, arms races, and
                        even major power war. When a great power declines, it
                        can topple existing international institutions, and
                        undermine the existing world order. In this seminar, we
                        will undertake a theoretical, historical, and contemporary
                        examination of rising and declining great powers, looking
                        at historical case studies (such as the rise of Germany,
                        Japan, and the United States), as well as contemporary
                        cases (the decline of Russia, American hegemony, and the
                        posited rise of China, India, and the European Union).
