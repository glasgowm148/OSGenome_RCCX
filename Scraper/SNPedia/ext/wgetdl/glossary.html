		<p><b>Cancer:</b> Contains gene variants associated with an increased or decreased risk of cancer.  (Ex. Increased or decreased susceptibility to Breast cancer or Melanoma).<br>
    	<p><b>Carrier Status:</b> Carrier Status is important in determining the gene variant’s effect. Each person inherits two variants of each gene, one from their biological father and one from their biological mother. A person is either a carrier of or affected by each gene. <br>
    	<p><b>Carrier:</b> A carrier for a particular gene variant is heterozygous for a gene variant with a recessive effect. This means that a carrier will not be affected by the gene variant; however if their child receives this gene variant from both parents, the child will potentially be affected.<br>
    	<p><b>Certainty:</b> The certainty of a gene variant describes how well-established the scientific data is behind the effect of the gene variant. <br>
    	<p><b>Compound Heterozygous:</b> The variants of two different genes work together to create the same effect as being homozygous for one of the genes.

	<div id="glossary-contentH" class="glossary-content">
		
		<h3>H</h3>
		
		<p><b>Health Category:</b> The health category of the gene variant is aspect of individual biology and health that the gene variant may affect. Many times, gene variants affect multiple aspects of individual biology or multiple areas of the body, and therefore fall into/appear in multiple categories. <br>
		<p><b>Health Effect:</b> Health Effect is based on three different variables. Severity, treatability and risk of the disease associated with the variant. The higher the health effect score, the more important it is to discuss with a medical professional. <br>
		<p><b>Hearing and Vision:</b> Contains gene variants that are associated with hearing and vision. (Ex. Increased or decreased susceptibility to Deafness or Age-related Macular Degeneration). <br>
		<p><b>Heart and Circulatory:</b> Contains gene variants that are associated with the heart and the circulatory system that are not specifically associated with the blood.  (Ex. Increased or decreased susceptibility to heart defects or arrhythmia). <br>
		<p><b>Heterozygous:</b> The two variants of the gene are different (the person has two different variants). <br>
		<p><b>Homozygous:</b> The two variants of the gene are the same.

		<h3>O</h3>
		
		<p><b>Other:</b> Contains gene variants that are benign, do not fit into the other health categories, or that may have been missed when sorted into health categories. Variants defined as "other" encompasses various possibilities. Some variants have a strong effect when homozygous and a weaker effect when heterozygous, or others only seem to have an effect on traits when another variant is also present.

		<h3>R</h3>

		<p><b>Rarity:</b> Rarity, also know as frequency in population or allele frequency, describes the percentage of the population that has this genetic variant. The smaller the frequency, the less common it is among the population and the more interesting it is to a healthcare professional. If there is “No Freq Recorded,”  the frequency of the gene variant is unknown. <br>
	    <p><b>Recessive:</b> Recessive variants are not expected to have the reported impact unless homozygous or compound heterozygous. <br>
	    <p><b>Risk:</b> Risk, also known as penetrance, describes how often individuals carrying the variant develop the associated disease. A variant with a higher penetrance means that a person with this variant is more likely to develop the associated disease. (Note: These scores are considered irrelevant for "benign" variants. Benign variants includes those which affect traits not considered to be medical/health issues, e.g. eye color.

	<div id="glossary-contentS" class="glossary-content">
		
		<h3>S</h3>
